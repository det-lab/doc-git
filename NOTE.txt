Note to others who may wish to work on/contribute to this project:

In the directory 'gerudo7 - Art' there is a file simply titled "pg1.tiff".
I started sketching a layout for a melodramatic manga about the master branch being broken.
I was stuck on where to go with it and then got busy with other things.
I may come back and finish it at some point, 
but if anyone else has interest in working off of this idea or the sketch,
they are certainly welcome to do so.
